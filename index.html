                BORED APE YACHT CLUB</h1>
            <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your <br> Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti <br> board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>
